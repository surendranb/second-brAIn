# Configurable Analysis Prompts - Feature Test

## What We Implemented

✅ **Fixed the "Show Prompt" Bug**

✅ **Added Settings Configuration**
- New "Analysis Prompts Configuration" section in settings
- 5 customizable prompt editors with syntax highlighting
- Reset to default buttons for each prompt
