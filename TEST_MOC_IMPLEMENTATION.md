# MOC Implementation Test Guide

## Overview
This document explains how to test the newly implemented MOC (Map of Content) organization system.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Features
1. **AI-Powered Hierarchy Generation**: The AI analyzes content and generates a 4-level knowledge hierarchy (Domain → Area → Topic → Concept)
2. **Automatic MOC Creation**: MOCs are created automatically based on AI analysis with rich metadata
3. **Learning Context Integration**: AI generates prerequisites, learning paths, and complexity assessments
4. **Enhanced MOC Templates**: Knowledge domain descriptions, prerequisite tracking, and complexity indicators
5. **Bidirectional Linking**: Notes are automatically linked to their MOCs with complexity annotations

### Technical Implementation
- **AI-Generated Hierarchy**: LLM produces structured hierarchy analysis as part of content processing
- **MOCManager**: Enhanced with learning context integration and prerequisite management
- **HierarchyAnalyzer**: Fallback heuristic analysis when AI hierarchy is unavailable
- **Learning Context**: Tracks prerequisites, related concepts, learning paths, and complexity levels

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Enable MOC functionality in plugin settings
2. Set MOC folder path (default: "MOCs")
3. Ensure you have an AI provider configured (Gemini or OpenRouter)

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Computer Science Content
1. Create a note from a programming/tech URL (e.g., a YouTube video about Python)
2. Expected behavior:
   - Note created in `Summaries/` folder
   - MOC created at `MOCs/Computer Science/Programming.md` (or similar subdomain)
   - Note includes MOC metadata in frontmatter
   - MOC updated with link to the new note

#### Test 2: Science Content
1. Create a note from a science-related URL
2. Expected behavior:
   - MOC created at `MOCs/Science/[Subdomain].md`
   - Proper categorization based on content

#### Test 3: Business Content
1. Create a note from a business/entrepreneurship URL
2. Expected behavior:
   - MOC created at `MOCs/Business/[Subdomain].md`
   - Business-specific categorization

### Verification Steps

#### Check Note Structure
The created note should have frontmatter like:
```yaml
---
title: "Note Title"
date: "2024-01-01"
type: "summary"
source:
  type: "youtube"
  url: "https://..."
status: "draft"
created: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
modified: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
hierarchy:
  level1: "Computer Science"
  level2: "Programming"
  level3: "Python Programming"
  level4: "Variables and Data Types"
moc: "MOCs/Computer Science/Programming.md"
learning_context:
  prerequisites: ["Basic Mathematics", "Computer Fundamentals"]
  related_concepts: ["Object-Oriented Programming", "Algorithms", "Data Structures"]
  learning_path: ["Programming Basics", "Python Syntax", "Advanced Python"]
  complexity_level: "intermediate"
  estimated_reading_time: "10-15 minutes"
---
```

#### Check MOC Structure
The MOC file should look like:
```markdown
---
type: "moc"
title: "Programming"
domain: "Computer Science"
created: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
updated: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
tags: ["moc", "computer-science"]
note_count: 1
learning_paths: []
---

# Programming

> [!info] Knowledge Domain
> This MOC organizes content within the **Computer Science** domain, specifically focusing on **Programming**.

## Learning Paths
- [[Python Programming Learning Path]]
- [[Variables and Data Types Learning Path]]

## Core Concepts
- [[Python Programming]]
- [[Variables and Data Types]]

## Related Topics
<!-- Related topics will be added automatically as new notes are created -->

## Prerequisites
- [[Basic Mathematics]]
- [[Computer Fundamentals]]

## Notes
- [[Your Note Title]] (intermediate)

---
*This MOC was automatically generated based on AI analysis and will be updated as new notes are added.*
```

### Expected File Structure
After testing, you should see:
```
vault/
├── MOCs/
│   ├── Computer Science/
│   │   └── Programming.md
│   ├── Science/
│   │   └── [Science Topic].md
│   └── Business/
│       └── [Business Topic].md
└── Summaries/
    ├── Note 1.md
    ├── Note 2.md
    └── Note 3.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **MOC not created**: Check if MOC functionality is enabled in settings
2. **Wrong categorization**: The heuristic analysis may need refinement for specific content
3. **File creation errors**: Check folder permissions and MOC folder path setting

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for detailed logs with `[MOCManager]` and `[CreateNote]` prefixes
- Verify settings are saved correctly
- Ensure AI provider is working for content analysis

## Next Steps
After successful testing, the implementation can be enhanced with:
1. AI-powered content analysis for better categorization
2. Learning path templates
3. Knowledge gap analysis
4. Advanced MOC relationships
