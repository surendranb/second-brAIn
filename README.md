# brAIn: AI-Powered Knowledge Organization for Obsidian

Transform any web content or YouTube video into organized, actionable knowledge that automatically integrates into your personal knowledge hierarchy with context-aware AI intelligence.

## What does brAIn do?

**brAIn doesn't just summarize content — it transforms information into structured knowledge and intelligently organizes it within your existing knowledge ecosystem.**

- 🌐 **Smart Content Processing**: Turn any web article or YouTube video into comprehensive notes
- 🧠 **Context-Aware AI Analysis**: AI understands your existing knowledge structure to make intelligent placement decisions
- 🗂️ **Intelligent Hierarchy Management**: Creates and maintains hierarchical knowledge maps (MOCs) that evolve with your learning

- 📚 **Learning Enhancement**: Identifies knowledge gaps and suggests optimal learning paths
- 🔧 **Robust Error Handling**: Advanced debugging and recovery systems ensure reliable knowledge creation

## Why brAIn?

**Problem**: Information overload leads to shallow learning, disconnected knowledge, and chaotic note organization.

**Solution**: brAIn transforms passive content consumption into active knowledge building by:
- Converting complex content into 13+ structured knowledge dimensions
- Understanding your existing knowledge structure to prevent hierarchy conflicts
- Automatically organizing information into Domain → Area → Topic → Concept hierarchies  
- Creating meaningful connections between new and existing knowledge
- Maintaining a centralized knowledge map that evolves intelligently
- Preserving context and enabling seamless knowledge retrieval
