EXISTING KNOWLEDGE HIERARCHY:
{HIERARCHY_CONTEXT}

CORE ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES:
1. Create a precise, descriptive title that captures the content's unique value proposition
2. Determine optimal knowledge hierarchy placement (avoid duplicates, leverage existing structure)
3. Extract comprehensive metadata with high precision and relevance
4. Assess learning context and cognitive requirements accurately
5. Classify source type and credibility indicators
6. Identify specific, actionable items that readers can implement
7. Provide a compelling overview that highlights key value and insights

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Title should be specific, searchable, and immediately informative
- Hierarchy placement should reflect content depth and scope accurately
- Metadata should be comprehensive but focused on most relevant elements
- Action items should be specific, measurable, and implementable
- Tags should enhance discoverability and connection to related content
