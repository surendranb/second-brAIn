export const HIERARCHY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `Analyze the following content and determine the optimal knowledge hierarchy placement for learning architecture. Focus on building pedagogically sound knowledge scaffolding rather than simple categorization.

CRITICAL HIERARCHY PRINCIPLES:

1. **LEARNING STRUCTURE FOCUS**: Organize for optimal knowledge building, not just categorization
2. **ATOMIC FINAL LEVEL**: The most specific level must represent a SINGLE, coherent concept
3. **PEDAGOGICAL SOUNDNESS**: Each level should represent a logical learning progression (foundations â†’ applications)
4. **ACADEMIC RIGOR**: Maintain proper conceptual relationships and domain accuracy

Please respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:

{
    "hierarchy": {
        "level1": "Knowledge Domain (e.g., Computer Science, Physics, Business, Philosophy, etc.)",
        "level2": "Learning Area within the domain (e.g., Machine Learning, Quantum Mechanics, Marketing, Ethics)",
        "level3": "Specific Topic (optional - only if content warrants deeper categorization)",
        "level4": "Single Key Concept (optional - final atomic concept level)"
    },
    "learning_context": {
        "prerequisites": ["Foundational Concept 1", "Foundational Concept 2"],
        "related_concepts": ["Related Topic 1", "Related Topic 2"],
        "learning_path": ["Progressive Step 1", "Progressive Step 2", "Progressive Step 3"],
        "complexity_level": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
        "estimated_reading_time": "X minutes"
    }
}

HIERARCHY GUIDELINES:

**Level 1 (Domain)**: Broad academic or practical domain
- Examples: "Computer Science", "Business", "Physics", "Philosophy"
- Should represent a major field of study or practice

**Level 2 (Area)**: Specific learning area within the domain  
- Examples: "Machine Learning", "Management", "Quantum Mechanics", "Ethics"
- Should represent a coherent subdiscipline or practice area

**Level 3 (Topic)**: Specific topic within the area (optional)
- Examples: "Neural Networks", "Organizational Behavior", "Wave Functions"
- Use ONLY when content focuses on a specific, well-defined topic
- Must be more specific than Level 2 but broader than Level 4

**Level 4 (Concept)**: Single atomic concept (optional)
- Examples: "Future of Work", "Cartography", "Backpropagation"
- Use ONLY when content focuses on ONE specific concept
- Must be atomic - NOT compound concepts like "AI & Future of Work"
- Should be the natural container for this specific content

LEARNING CONTEXT GUIDELINES:

**Prerequisites**: What foundational knowledge is needed?
- Focus on concepts learners should understand BEFORE this content
- Avoid listing advanced concepts as prerequisites
- Think: "What do I need to know first?"

**Related Concepts**: What connects to this content?
- Topics that share conceptual relationships
- Cross-domain connections that enrich understanding
- Concepts that would benefit from being studied together

**Learning Path**: Progressive sequence for mastery
- Start with foundational concepts
- Build toward more complex applications
- End with advanced or specialized topics

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Beginner: Introductory, requires minimal prerequisites
- Intermediate: Builds on existing knowledge, moderate depth
- Advanced: Requires substantial background, high cognitive load

Remember: The goal is to create a learning architecture that helps users build knowledge systematically, not just organize content for storage.`;

CRITICAL HIERARCHY RULES:
- Focus on LEARNING PROGRESSION not just categorization
- Final level must be ATOMIC (single concept only)
- Good: "Future of Work", "Cartography", "Neural Networks"  
- Bad: "AI & Future of Work", "Math & Cartography"
- Each level should enable learning scaffolding

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL JSON REQUIREMENTS:
1. Your response MUST be ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no markdown, no extra text
2. Start with { and end with } - nothing else
3. Use double quotes for ALL strings
4. No trailing commas
5. No comments in JSON
6. If you add explanations, the system will FAIL
